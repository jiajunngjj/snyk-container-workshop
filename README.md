# Introduction to Snyk Container Workshop

Snyk Container helps you find and fix vulnerabilities in container images. With snyk container Scale your security capabilities by enabling developers to quickly eliminate a multitude of vulnerabilities by upgrading to a more secure base image or rebuilding when the base image is outdated

You may not always have access to the original source code that runs in your containers, but vulnerabilities in your code dependencies are still important. Snyk can detect and monitor open source dependencies for popular languages as part of the container scan

In this hands-on workshop we will achieve the follow:

* Step 1 Fork the Goof Application
* Step 2 Configure GitHub Integration 
* Step 3 Configure Docker Hub Integration 
* Step 4 Find vulnerabilities in Goof’s Dockerfile 
* Step 5 Fix the Dockerfile FROM tag using a Pull Request 
* Step 6 Build / Push the image to Docker Hub 
* Step 7 Test using the Snyk CLI for your goof container 
* Step 8 Test using the “Add to Project” Docker Hub Integration
